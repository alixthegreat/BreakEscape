# Cyber Insurance Scenario Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSING (Validated 2026-04-03)

## Validation Results

- ✅ Schema validation passed
- ✅ ERB rendering successful
- ✅ All global variables defined
- ✅ Dungeon graph generated (3 nodes, 2 edges)

## Fixes Applied

### Structural Fixes
1. **Rooms Object Structure** - Changed from array `[]` to object `{}` format
   - Converted room definitions to proper room object keyed by room ID
   - Fixed room connection definitions (north/south instead of doors array)
   - Adjusted object property names to match schema (type, name, text, etc.)

2. **StartItemsInInventory** - Fixed phone item structure
   - Changed from `display_name` to `name` field (required by schema)
   - Added `phoneId` field for proper phone NPC linking
   - Added `takeable: true` field
   - Moved description to `observations` field

## Scenario Structure

**Rooms**:
- `meridian_claims_suite` — Main claims assessment room (start)
- `meridian_evidence_archive` — PIN-locked secure filing area

**Objects**:
- 10 readable documents (policy, incident report, forensic exhibits, attribution brief, etc.)
- 1 PIN-locked underwriting file cabinet with nested readable file

**Critical Documents**:
- Policy Binder — warranty schedule, exclusions, cooperation clause
- IT Forensics Exhibit — contractor account breach, jump server, SOC gaps
- OT Forensics Exhibit — historian data, SIS configuration changes, evidence destruction
- Warranty Evidence — W-07, W-03, W-09, W-12 assessment
- NCSC Attribution Brief — GREYMANTLE + Ferryman, legal threshold, act-of-war analysis
- Underwriting File — pre-incident knowledge, renewal decision, CLAIM-INS-009

**Phone Contacts** (via claims_phone):
- James Whitworth — Albion Risk Manager
- David Osei — Fairbridge Loss Adjuster
- Robert Ngata — NCSC Liaison

## Scenario Puzzle

This scenario is primarily **investigative and decision-focused** rather than action/adventure:
- Players read documents to understand the claim and evidence
- Critical decision point: Coverage determination (Full / Proportional / Deny)
- Secondary decision: Act-of-war exclusion (Invoke / Accept Risk / Waive)
- Teaching goal: Insurance claims decision-making under ambiguity

**Graph**: 3 nodes (PIN-locked archive door, underwriting cabinet, decision choices)

## Good Practices Detected

- ✅ Event-driven architecture foundation
- ✅ Cross-room connections properly defined
- ✅ Global variables for state tracking

## Remaining Development TODOs

### NPCs Needed (3 NPCs)
- `eleanor_vance` — Claims manager (currently partial structure)
- `james_whitworth` — Phone NPC (Risk manager)
- `robert_ngata` — Phone NPC (NCSC liaison)

### Ink Files Needed (3 files)
- `ink/npc_eleanor_vance.ink` — Claims assessment dialogue with three outcomes
- `ink/npc_james_whitworth.ink` — Phone contact for incident context
- `ink/npc_robert_ngata.ink` — Phone contact for attribution legal analysis

### Sprites Needed
- `inspector_female` — Eleanor Vance character sprite (PLACEHOLDER available)
- `room_meridian_claims` — Claims suite room tilemap (currently: room_office)
- `room_meridian_archive` — Evidence archive room tilemap (currently: room_it)

### Minigames (Optional)
- FDP (Forensic Data Platform) VM terminal — not strictly required; scenario works with document review only
- CMS (Claims Management System) terminal — not currently implemented

## Non-Blocking Recommendations

1. Add opening briefing cutscene (Eleanor's introduction)
2. Add objectives/tasks for structured play flow
3. Add dynamic music events
4. Add hostile NPCs (if gameplay includes tension)
5. Add variety of lock types (currently: PIN only)
6. Add puzzle graph metadata for flow visualization

---

**Status**: Scenario is **runnable** with documents and decision structure in place.
**Next Phase**: Implement Eleanor Vance NPC dialogue and phone contact scripts.
**Teaching Focus**: Insurance claims analysis, warranty interpretation, legal ambiguity under state-sponsored attacks.
