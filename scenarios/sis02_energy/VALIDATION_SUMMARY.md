# Energy Scenario Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSING (Validated 2026-04-03)

## Validation Results

- ✅ Schema validation passed
- ✅ ERB rendering successful
- ✅ All global variables defined
- ✅ All cross-references validated
- ✅ Dungeon graph generated

## Fixes Applied

### Global Variable Addition
- Added missing `plant_room_badge_collected: false` to globalVariables
  - Referenced in plant_room_badge object's onPickup handler
  - Tracks when player collects the RFID badge for battery hall access

## Scenario Structure

**Critical Path**:
- Assess anomaly (Aim 1)
- Investigate root cause (Aim 2-4)
- Decide on network isolation (Aim 5)
- Authorize isolation (Aim 6)
- Manage consequences (Aim 7-8)
- Optional: Notify Trent Water (Aim 9)
- Debrief (Aim 10)

**Graph Statistics**:
- Puzzle nodes: 12
- Story nodes: 10
- Total integrated nodes: 22
- Cross-references: 13 edges

## Good Practices Detected

- ✅ Event-driven cutscene architecture (person-chat debrief)
- ✅ Skip-on-resume pattern for opening briefing
- ✅ Collection tracking for inventory items

## Remaining Development TODOs

### Sprites Needed (with placeholders in place)
- `engineer_female`: PLACEHOLDER (from male_nerd.png) → needs commissioning
- `inspector_female`: PLACEHOLDER (from female_security_guard.png) → needs commissioning

### Ink Files Needed (4 NPCs)
- `npc_priya_chandra.ink` — SCADA engineer, opening briefing
- `npc_marcus_webb.ink` — OT security, phone NPC
- `npc_tom_hadley.ink` — SOC analyst, phone NPC
- `npc_dr_bashir.ink` — NCSC inspector, debrief NPC

### Hacktivity VMs Needed (2 VMs)
- `albion_scada_historian` — Historian trend viewer with flat-line anomaly
- `albion_eng_workstation` — Jump server access log analysis

### Room Sprites Needed (3 rooms)
- `room_scada_control_room` (currently: room_office placeholder)
- `room_battery_hall` (currently: room_servers placeholder)
- `room_engineering_workshop` (currently: room_it placeholder)

### Custom Minigames (6 games)
- MG-01: ESD Pushbutton Interaction Screen
- MG-02: SIS Configuration Threshold Display
- MG-03: Facility Alarm Panel State Machine
- MG-04: Hydrogen Gas Alarm Progression
- MG-05: NIS 72-Hour Notification Clock
- MG-06: Network Architecture Diagram (Purdue Model)

All placeholders use functional stubs (readable text, PIN locks, smartscreen displays) that allow scenario progression.

## Non-Blocking Recommendations

1. Add `player` configuration for hero sprite setup
2. Add `showProgress: true` to collect_items tasks
3. Consider adding patrol waypoints to NPCs for dynamic movement
4. Consider adding timedMessages to phone NPCs for narrative flow
5. Consider adding security tools for interactive gameplay
6. Consider adding dynamic music events
7. Consider adding hostile NPCs for tension
8. Consider adding puzzle_graph_unlocks for dungeon graph visualization

---

**Status**: Scenario is **runnable** with functional stubs in place for all minigames.
**Next Phase**: Complete Ink story files and commission sprite assets.
