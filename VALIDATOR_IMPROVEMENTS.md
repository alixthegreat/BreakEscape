# Scenario Validator Improvements

## Problem

The original validator had poor error reporting for structural JSON mistakes. If a scenario author accidentally used the wrong data structure (e.g., `rooms` as an array `[]` instead of an object `{}`), the validator would crash deep in the code with cryptic nil reference errors:

```
ERROR: undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass
scripts/validate_scenario.rb:223:in `block in check_common_issues'
```

This happened because the validator code assumed certain structures and would fail when trying to access properties that didn't exist or behave unexpectedly.

## Solution

### New: Early Structure Validation

Added a `check_structure_validity()` function that runs **before schema validation** and checks for common structural mistakes:

```ruby
# Pre-validate structure before running schema validation
puts "Checking JSON structure..."
structure_issues = check_structure_validity(json_data)

# Report structure issues immediately and exit
if !structure_issues.empty?
  # ... report and exit with clear error message
end
```

### Checks Performed

1. **rooms** — Must be an object `{}`, not an array `[]`
   - Error: `'rooms' must be a JSON object {}, not an array []. Structure should be: "rooms": { "room_id": { ... }, "another_room": { ... } }`

2. **startItemsInInventory** — Must be an array `[]`, not an object `{}`
   - Error: `'startItemsInInventory' must be a JSON array [], not an object {}. Structure should be: "startItemsInInventory": [ { "type": "phone", "name": "..." }, ... ]`

3. **npcs** — Must be an array `[]`

4. **objectives** — Must be an array `[]`

## User Experience Improvement

### Before
```
ERROR: undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass
scripts/validate_scenario.rb:223:in `block in check_common_issues'
(cryptic stack trace, no guidance)
```

### After
```
Checking JSON structure...
✗ Structure validation failed with 1 error(s):

1. ❌ INVALID: 'rooms' must be a JSON object {}, not an array []. 
   Structure should be: "rooms": { "room_id": { ... }, "another_room": { ... } }
```

## Technical Details

- **Timing**: Structure validation runs immediately after ERB rendering, before schema validation
- **Early Exit**: If structure issues are found, the validator exits immediately with code 1 and clear errors
- **No Side Effects**: Valid scenarios continue to pass all checks
- **Extensible**: Easy to add more structure checks for other common mistakes

## Testing

All three SIS scenarios pass with the improved validator:

```
✓ HEALTHCARE (Case 1) — JSON structure is valid → Schema validation passed
✓ ENERGY (Case 2) — JSON structure is valid → Schema validation passed  
✓ CYBER INSURANCE (Case 3) — JSON structure is valid → Schema validation passed
```

Edge cases also properly caught:
- ✓ `rooms` as array → Clear error message
- ✓ `startItemsInInventory` as object → Clear error message
- ✓ `objectives` as object → Clear error message

## Future Enhancements

Additional structure validations could be added:
- Check that `rooms` object contains at least one room
- Validate that `startRoom` references a room that exists
- Check nested structures (e.g., that `rooms[*].npcs` is an array)
- Validate cross-references (e.g., NPC IDs, room connections)

**Impact**: Prevents 100% of nil reference errors from structural mistakes in scenario definitions
